# VOAIP - Voice Over AI Protection

🎙️ **Hello and welcome!**

**VOAIP** (Voice Over AI Protection) is a research-driven project that focuses on detecting voice-based deepfake attacks in VoIP (Voice over IP) communication systems.

As synthetic voice technologies become more advanced, so do the threats. VOAIP aims to serve as a defense layer by integrating AI-powered detection techniques directly into voice call infrastructure — helping verify, authenticate, and protect real human voices.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project explores:

- Voice spoofing & deepfake detection
- Real-time voice verification in VoIP environments
- AI-based anomaly detection for audio streams

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an experimental project and still under active development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## 📦 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yugicao/voaip.git
